<h2>(Red means its for the programmers. Its to help us figure out what we need to do!!!!)</h2>







    
<p2>It will be based on a intercom system which should make it easier on our part. (You push the button and you speak. And it works both ways. But we have to figure out how to have people on the same website at the same time. without it being a duplicate website.So basiclly we need to be on a server. one person at a time can speak so there is no confusion. lets make the space bar the mic button </p2>


<br></br>
<p2>Hey do you think we should make a user bases? Like a google acount thing or do you think that will be too much?</p2>
